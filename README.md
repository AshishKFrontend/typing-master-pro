## 🧐 The Problem Statement
Most typing websites are built for desktop viewports. When accessed on a mobile device in **Landscape Mode**:
1.  **Screen Real Estate:** Browser address bars and keyboards consume 60% of the screen.
2.  **Focus Loss:** Touching the screen often triggers the virtual keyboard, disrupting the physical keyboard flow.
3.  **Audio Latency:** Standard web audio implementations cause a delay (lag) on mobile browsers, breaking the typing rhythm.

## 💡 The Solution (Engineering Approach)
**TypingMaster OTG** solves these issues using a mobile-first, performance-centric approach:

### 1. Adaptive Viewport Engine
- Utilizes **CSS Container Queries** and `dvh` (Dynamic Viewport Height) units to ensure the UI fits perfectly without scrolling, regardless of the browser's UI bars.
- Implements a **Smart Scroll Algorithm** in JS that keeps the active line centered dynamically.

### 2. Zero-Latency Audio System
- Replaces standard `new Audio().play()` with a **DOM Node Cloning Strategy**.
- **Technique:** `audioNode.cloneNode(true).play()` allows overlapping sounds during high-speed typing bursts (100+ WPM) without audio cutting or lagging.

### 3. Focus-Lock Mechanism
- Custom Event Listeners (`blur`, `keydown`) ensure the input field automatically re-claims focus if the user accidentally touches the UI, preventing the virtual keyboard from popping up.
